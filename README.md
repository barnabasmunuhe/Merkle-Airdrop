# 🪂 Merkle Airdrop Protocol (Foundry Edition)

A **secure, dual-verified token airdrop system** built with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), combining **Merkle Proofs + EIP-712 signatures** to ensure only eligible users can claim tokens.

This project demonstrates:
- 🔐 Cryptographically secure airdrops (Merkle Trees)
- ✍️ EIP-712 typed data signatures
- 🧾 Anti-replay + single-claim enforcement
- ⚙️ Foundry-based scripting & automation
- 🧠 Real-world airdrop architecture design

# 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

Most airdrop systems rely on a single verification method.

This protocol enforces two independent cryptographic guarantees:

- 🌳 Merkle Proof verification → proves eligibility
- ✍️ EIP-712 signature verification → proves authorization
- 🚫 Prevents replay attacks using on-chain state tracking
- 🧾 Ensures one-time claim per address

👉 This is a **production-grade token distribution system**, not a demo.

# ⚙️ Getting Started

## Requirements

- Git
- Foundry
- Node.js (optional)

---

## Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/merkle-airdrop
cd merkle-airdrop
forge install
forge build
````

---

# 🧩 Core Architecture

## 🔐 Claim Flow

```
User → Signature Check (EIP-712)
     → Merkle Proof Verification
     → Already Claimed Check
     → Token Transfer
```

---

## 🌳 Merkle Verification

Each leaf is constructed as:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encode(account, amount))
```

* Leaves are double-hashed to prevent second pre-image attacks
* Merkle root generated off-chain
* Verification performed using OpenZeppelin `MerkleProof`

---

## ✍️ Signature Verification (EIP-712)

Typed structured message:

```solidity
AirdropClaim(address account, uint256 amount)
```

* Prevents unauthorized claims
* Ensures signer explicitly approves claim
* Uses `ECDSA.tryRecover` for safe recovery

---

# 🚀 Deploying Contracts

## 🧪 Local Deployment

```bash
forge script script/DeployMerkleAirdrop.s.sol \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

---

# 🧪 Running Scripts

## 📦 Generate Input Data

Creates whitelist dataset for Merkle tree:

```bash
forge script script/GenerateInput.s.sol
```

Output:

```
/script/target/input.json
```

---

## 🌳 Build Merkle Tree & Proofs

Generates:

* Merkle root
* Leaf nodes
* Merkle proofs per user
* JSON output for claims

```bash
forge script script/MakeMerkle&SplitSignature.s.sol
```

---

## 🪂 Claim Airdrop

Run interaction script:

```bash
forge script script/interact.s.sol --broadcast
```

Or manual call:

```bash
cast send <AIRDROP_ADDRESS> \
"claim(address,uint256,bytes32[],uint8,bytes32,bytes32)" \
<ACCOUNT> <AMOUNT> <PROOF> <v> <r> <s>
```

---

# 🔐 Security Considerations

* Single-claim enforcement via mapping
* EIP-712 signature validation
* Merkle root immutability
* Double hashing for leaf safety
* SafeERC20 transfers
* Explicit revert errors for auditability

---

# 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Merkle Trees
* EIP-712 typed data signing
* ECDSA signature recovery
* Foundry scripting system
* Off-chain computation pipelines
* JSON data generation
* Token distribution design patterns
* Crypto verification primitives

---
